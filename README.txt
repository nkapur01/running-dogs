Lab 3

I successfully implemented the following into my omfgdogs webpage
  repeating background image of the omfgdogs.gif
  Background music that loops
  a link on the bottom right to omfgdogs.com

  I used a css stylesheet to format the background image, the margin size, and the positioning of the link

  I spent approximately 60 minutes on this lab
